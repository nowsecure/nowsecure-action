# An example workflow using the NowSecure Issues action.
# This action is run each time a commit is pushed to the "main" branch,
# on pull requests or the workflow is manually triggered
#
# This workflow builds an Android application saving the output apk as
# an artifact in the "build" phase.
#
# In the "scan" phase the apk is uploaded to NowSecure, generating a
# report.
#
# In the "issues" phase the report is downloaded from NowSecure and
# issues are generated for findings that match the filter criteria
# (which can be overridden in .nsconfig.yml)
#
# In the CI/CD config:
# - Set the NS_TOKEN secret to a NowSecure Api token for your NowSecure user
# - Set the NS_GROUP_ID secret to the id of the group to which the
#      application should be added.
